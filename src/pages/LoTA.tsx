								The Land of The Awakened is a religious term brought by The Church of The Eight, which shapes the political boundaries of the habitation space of the sleepers—creations of the eight
								dreamers that carry free will. The Land of The Awakened—or LoTA is the central geography in the world of Somnium, where the sleepers struggle in order to protect their civilizations
								and survive.
							</p>
							<p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
								What makes LoTA unique is the access to arcane powers being scarce, and other magical practices such as holy magic and nature magic being questioned by The Church of The Eight. People
								who carry these powers tend to not reveal themselves out of the fear that they might find themselves burning in a steak, their sentence read by the bishop of their diocese. The
								practice of arcane magic is forbid to humans by the elves after the War of Flames. However, this reservence is different in countries other than the Senate and People of Utland.
							</p>
							<p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
								Especially countries like Gerontocracy of Ard Caëd, Kingdom of Dol Caëd, and Veretia is where gnomes, halflings, and elves interact with arcane in their lives more freely, connected to
								their differences in beliefs with SPQU. They became more conservative with their arcane after the War of Flames, and the destruction that humans caused.
							</p>
							<p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
								After the War of Flames, when the countries are tired and elves turned their heads of a darkness rising in further south of the Endless Forest, decentralized power groups and
								individuals are in need of adventurers who will help them to pick of the meats of political, military, economic, religious, and magical influence from the bones of the Land of The
								Awakened.
							</p>
							<p className="leading-7 [&:not(:first-child)]:mt-6">
								LoTA is a medieval low-fantasy setting that can be played with many different TTRPG systems such as Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, Fate, and many more.
